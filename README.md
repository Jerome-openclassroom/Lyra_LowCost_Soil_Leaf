# Low-Cost Soil and Leaf Analysis Protocol for Ecological Monitoring

This project presents a fully operational and low-cost protocol for assessing soil characteristics and green density in plant leaves. Designed for ecological monitoring, educational settings, and citizen science projects, this toolkit combines simple tests and scanner-based digital image analysis.

## Overview

The protocol is divided into two main components:

---

### I. Soil Analysis Protocol

Low-tech but effective methods are used to estimate key soil parameters:

- **Texture**: Using sedimentation test in a Lamotte tube with water and table salt (as a colloidal dispersant).
- **Structure and Structural Stability**: Based on immersion and observation.
- **Organic Matter**: Tested using hydrogen peroxide (Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚) with bubbling indicating presence.
- **Carbonates**: Verified by strong effervescence when in contact with vinegar (20Â°).
- **Soil pH**: Tested with standard colorimetric strips.
- **Optional parameters**:
  - **pH KCl**: Measured alongside pH Hâ‚‚O using potassium chloride (food-grade) for estimating exchangeable acidity.
  - **Exchangeable Aluminum**: Recommended in acid forest soils (granite base, conifer dominance).

All these tools are inexpensive, generally available in pharmacies or supermarkets.

### II. Leaf Green Density via Scanner

Using a flatbed scanner, leaf surface and green density (DO_green) are measured with precision. This data enables ecological models of plant productivity.

- A plasticized reference green chart was created and field-tested under direct sunlight.
- DO_green values were calibrated with ImageJ using a known gradient.
- Accuracy of visual chart was compared with scanner output: error margins are acceptable for field work.
- Validation of scanner DO_green was performed using SPAD502 (Minolta) readings in the companion repo:

## Modeling Primary Production Potential

From the scanner-based dataset, one can estimate a theoretical productivity using the following parameters:

- **Mean green density**
- **Mean leaf area**
- **Mean number of leaves per tree**
- **Mean number of trees per hectare**
- **Target surface (ha)**
- **Integrated solar flux** (W/mÂ² ideally, Lux otherwise)
- **Photosynthesis efficiency (1â€“2%)**
- **Corrective coefficient** derived from comparison with actual primary net production

$$
P_{model} = DO_{green} \times A_{leaf} \times N_{leaves} \times D_{trees} \times S_{ha} \times I_{sun} \times R_{photo} \times k_{species}
$$

Where \(k_{species}\) is the species-specific empirical correction coefficient.

This project demonstrates how ecological field monitoring can be democratized using inexpensive tools combined with digital processing and AI guidance.
