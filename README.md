# Low-Cost Soil and Leaf Analysis Protocol for Ecological Monitoring

This project presents a fully operational and low-cost protocol for assessing soil characteristics and green density in plant leaves. Designed for ecological monitoring, educational settings, and citizen science projects, this toolkit combines simple tests and scanner-based digital image analysis.

## Overview

The protocol is divided into two main components:

---

### I. Soil Analysis Protocol

Low-tech but effective methods are used to estimate key soil parameters:

- **Texture**: Using sedimentation test in a Lamotte tube with water and table salt (as a colloidal dispersant).
- **Structure and Structural Stability**: Based on immersion and observation.
- **Organic Matter**: Tested using hydrogen peroxide (H‚ÇÇO‚ÇÇ) with bubbling indicating presence.
- **Carbonates**: Verified by strong effervescence when in contact with vinegar (20¬∞).
- **Soil pH**: Tested with standard colorimetric strips.
- **Optional parameters**:
  - **pH KCl**: Measured alongside pH H‚ÇÇO using potassium chloride (food-grade) for estimating exchangeable acidity.
  - **Exchangeable Aluminum**: Recommended in acid forest soils (granite base, conifer dominance).

All these tools are inexpensive, generally available in pharmacies or supermarkets.

### II. Leaf Green Density via Scanner

Using a flatbed scanner, leaf surface and green density (DO_green) are measured with precision. This data enables ecological models of plant productivity.

- A plasticized reference green chart was created and field-tested under direct sunlight.
- DO_green values were calibrated with ImageJ using a known gradient.
- Accuracy of visual chart was compared with scanner output: error margins are acceptable for field work.
- Validation of scanner DO_green was performed using SPAD502 (Minolta) readings in the companion repo:

### III. üß™ Nitrate Extraction Protocol (Field-Applied)

This nitrate extraction method was routinely used in professional agronomic diagnostics, and has been re-implemented here to support soil nutrient balance analysis in the Lyra_LowCost_Soil_Leaf project.

Step 1 ‚Äì Sample homogenization
A 1:1 mixture of dry soil and demineralized water is prepared in a sealed container.
The mixture is then homogenized using a cordless drill equipped with a paddle mixer, ensuring complete dispersion of soluble elements.


Step 2 ‚Äì Reverse filtration
The slurry is poured into a folded paper filter cone, fixed over a clean collection jar.
Gravity-based reverse filtration is used to obtain a clear filtrate, suitable for nitrate testing.


Step 3 ‚Äì Nitrate reading
A JBL 7-in-1 test strip is briefly immersed in the collected filtrate.
After 1 minute, the nitrate concentration is estimated by comparing the test zone to the printed scale on the tube.


Interpretation
In the tested soil sample, the estimated nitrate concentration (NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª) was close to 100 mg/L.
This high value is consistent with the vigorous vegetative growth observed in the tomato plants, suggesting a nitrogen-potassium imbalance.
Such an imbalance may explain the tendency of the plants to produce excess foliage with reduced fruiting.

## Modeling Primary Production Potential

From the scanner-based dataset, one can estimate a theoretical productivity using the following parameters:

- **Mean green density**
- **Mean leaf area**
- **Mean number of leaves per tree**
- **Mean number of trees per hectare**
- **Target surface (ha)**
- **Integrated solar flux** (W/m¬≤ ideally, Lux otherwise)
- **Photosynthesis efficiency (1‚Äì2%)**
- **Corrective coefficient** derived from comparison with actual primary net production

$$
P_{model} = DO_{green} \times A_{leaf} \times N_{leaves} \times D_{trees} \times S_{ha} \times I_{sun} \times R_{photo} \times k_{species}
$$

Where \(k_{species}\) is the species-specific empirical correction coefficient.
